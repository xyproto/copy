# TODO

- [ ] The ability to copy from one file to another
- [ ] Refuse to copy from one file to an existing file
- [ ] Progress bar
- [ ] Concurrent copying, where one file is read while another is written
- [ ] The option of using `rsync` under the hood for everything
- [ ] A way to check if a file exists, over `ssh`
- [ ] Concurrent progress bars

## Ideas

* 2FA support for copying files
* 2FA support for being a ssh client
